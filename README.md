Snakes and ladders originated in India as part of a family of dice board games that included gyan chauper and pachisi (known in English as Ludo and Parcheesi). The game made its way to England and was sold as "Snakes and Ladders", then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as Chutes and Ladders (an "improved new version of England's famous indoor sport") by game publisher Milton Bradley Company in 1943.
